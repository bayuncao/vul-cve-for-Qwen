Qwen has a command execution vulnerability

Qwen is a very large-scale language model launched by Alibaba Cloud. Its functions include multi-round dialogue, copywriting creation, logical reasoning, multi-modal understanding, and multi-language support. It is able to interact with humans for multiple rounds, and also incorporates multi-modal knowledge understanding. It also has the ability to create copywriting, and can continue to write novels, write emails, etc.

The Qwen project uses the @dataclass syntax in the dataclasses library in `finetune.py`. By constructing a malicious script, commands can be passed in and executed externally.
